# Your rule content

- Don't edit existing type definatinos, instead try writing the rest of the codes based on those type definations.
- If need to edit a type defination ask user to give permission to do so.
- For multiple types or components in a same file the parent should be on the top and then the childs. So that the code can be read from top to down and when need to take a deeper look into a specific child then can scroll down.
- All the types should be declared in the types.ts file.
